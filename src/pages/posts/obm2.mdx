I just presented [open-bank-mark](https://github.com/openweb-nl/open-bank-mark) at the [The Dutch Clojure Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Dutch-Clojure-Meetup/). Focussing more on the Clojure libraries used than I did at the Kafka meetup.

In preparation I tested with setting `linger.ms` to 0 and 100 ms. Witch is one of the variables in Kafka that's really affecting your latency and throughput.

It was nice of [Open Web](https://www.openweb.nl/) to sponsor. Because it's a small meetup with only about 10 people today, there was lots of room for questions, and also sometimes for other people to answer when I didn't know. The raw data can be found [here](https://github.com/gklijs/open-bank-mark/tree/100-vs-0-linger-ms).
