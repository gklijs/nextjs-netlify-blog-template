Last few months have been really busy. I was finalising the now finally published [blog post](https://www.confluent.io/blog/getting-started-with-rust-and-kafka)about using Rust with Kafka. And also preparing to talk at [GraphQL Summit](https://summit.graphql.com/) which will be the first conference I'll be speaking.

Been a really hectic time especially since there was also some trouble at home, leaving less time as usual to do stuff. But I'm really looking forward to visit San Fransisco and learning more about GraphQL.

I'm still busy with the finishing touches to the repo that is more centred about the GraphQL part. One of the most important changes is using the GraphQL endpoint to increase the load of the system. If all goes well the presentation will be recorded.
